## About the project

Sojobo is a game made in the [Metroid Vania Game Jam](https://itch.io/jam/metroidvania-month-8). This was the first project of the team [Yuugen Studios](https://www.instagram.com/yuugenstudio/?hl=pt-br)
in this one we had our first experience making a game in a short period, this is the first project but not the last one of the Studio, more stuff better than this one will come.
